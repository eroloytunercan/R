## How to Use the Prompts

These prompts are designed to give you a quick, friendly math lesson before you meet the finance idea that uses it. Use them in short, focused sessions (10–15 minutes) and keep the flow: **learn → practice → apply.**

1. **Pick one topic at a time.**  
   Start with the chapter you’re studying (the chapter tags are shown next to each title). Don’t jump around — master one building block before stacking the next.

2. **Copy–paste the prompt exactly.**  
   Paste it into your AI tutor (e.g., ChatGPT). The wording is tuned to get a plain-English, step-by-step lesson with small numbers first.  
   If anything feels fast or unclear, say:  
   - “slower”  
   - “use even smaller numbers”  
   - “don’t use formulas yet”  
   - “show one more example”

3. **Make it interactive.**  
   After the explanation, add follow-ups like:  
   - “Give me 3 practice problems, from easy to medium.”  
   - “Now hide the answers; I’ll try first.”  
   - “Check my work and explain any mistake in one sentence.”  
   - “Summarize the key rules in 5 bullet points.”

4. **Bridge to finance in one sentence.**  
   Each prompt ends with a one-line connection to Corporate Finance.  
   Ask the tutor: “Show a tiny finance example using this math, consistent with that sentence.”

5. **Use the linked videos for a second pass.**  
   If a concept still feels shaky, watch the listed YouTube clip for that section, then rerun the prompt and try two fresh problems.

6. **Practice calculator discipline.**  
   When relevant, ask: “Show the BA II Plus keystrokes and the math side-by-side.”  
   Always clear memory between problems and follow PEMDAS carefully.

**Micro-workflow example:**  
Run *Powers & Roots* → ask for 3 practice questions → ask “now solve for the exponent using logarithms” → finish with “give me one 2-line finance example that uses this idea.”

## Topics & Prompts

### 1. Arithmetic & Percentages (Ch. 1, 2, 4)

> You are a patient math tutor. Please explain basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using very small numbers first, like 2 + 3 or 10 ÷ 2. Then show how fractions work, like 1/2 or 3/4, and how to turn them into decimals. Next, explain percentages step by step: what 10% means, how to convert between percentages and decimals (e.g., 25% = 0.25), and how to calculate percentage changes (e.g., from 100 to 110 = 10% increase). Use everyday examples like money, shopping discounts, or test scores.

👉 In finance, we use percentages to show returns — for example, if a stock price goes from $100 to $110, that’s a 10% return.

### 2. Powers & Roots (Ch. 1–3, 6)

> Please explain powers (exponents) to me in very simple words, as if I’ve never seen them before. Start with examples like 2² = 4 and 3³ = 27. Show how exponents are just repeated multiplication. Then explain square roots and cube roots as the ‘reverse’ of powers, like the number that multiplies by itself to make another number (e.g., √9 = 3). Finally, explain the general idea of n-th roots with easy examples. Use small step-by-step demonstrations instead of formulas at first.

👉 In finance, exponents show how money grows over time, such as 1.05¹⁰ for 10 years of 5% interest.

### 3. Logarithms (Ch. 1–3, 6)

> Please explain logarithms in the simplest way possible. Start by reminding me that exponents mean repeated multiplication, like 2³ = 8. Then explain that logarithms ask the opposite question: ‘2 raised to what power equals 8?’ (Answer = 3). Use lots of small examples, like log₂(16) = 4. Then explain logs with base 10, like log₁₀(100) = 2. Show me how to use logarithms to solve for time or growth rate when we know the starting and ending numbers. Keep everything step by step and beginner-friendly.

👉 In finance, we use logarithms to solve for how many years it takes an investment to double at a certain rate.

### 4. Growth & Compounding (Ch. 2–3, 6, 7)

> Please explain the difference between simple growth and compound growth in math. Start with simple growth, like adding 10 every year: 100 → 110 → 120. Then explain compound growth, like multiplying by 1.1 every year: 100 → 110 → 121 → 133.1. Use easy step-by-step calculations. Show me why compounding grows faster than simple addition. Finally, explain how compounding works for different time periods (yearly, monthly, daily), using very small examples like 100 growing at 5% per year.

👉 In finance, compounding explains why saving $100 at 10% interest for 2 years grows to $121, not just $120.

### 5. Sequences & Series (Ch. 2–3, 6, 7, 8, 9)

> Please explain what a sequence is in math with very simple examples, like 2, 4, 6, 8 (arithmetic sequence) and 2, 4, 8, 16 (geometric sequence). Then explain what a series is: adding the terms of a sequence. Show me how to add a simple arithmetic series, like 2 + 4 + 6. Then show me a geometric series, like 1 + 2 + 4 + 8, and explain how the total grows. Finally, explain infinite geometric series, like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + … and why it gets close to 1. Use small numbers and no scary formulas at first.

👉 In finance, series appear when adding up repeated payments like annuities (e.g., paying $100 every year).

### 6. Algebra & Equations (Ch. 1–3, 6, 7, 8, 9)

> Please explain algebra in very simple words. Start with what a variable is (like x standing for an unknown number). Then show how to solve simple equations step by step, like x + 5 = 10 → x = 5. Next, show equations where the variable is multiplied, like 3x = 12 → x = 4. Then explain how to rearrange formulas, for example solving for t in FV = PV × (1+r)^t. Use very easy examples first, and then show slightly harder ones. Keep it step by step.

👉 In finance, we solve equations to find unknowns like the interest rate, the present value, or the number of years.

### 7. Averages & Weighted Averages (Ch. 4, 9)

> Please explain averages (means) in very basic terms. Show how to calculate the average of small numbers, like (2 + 4 + 6)/3 = 4. Then explain weighted averages: when some numbers count more than others. Use a simple example, like if a test counts 70% and homework counts 30% toward the grade. Show step by step how to multiply each score by its weight, add them up, and divide if necessary. Keep the examples very small and simple.

👉 In finance, weighted averages are used in WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital), where debt and equity are combined by their importance.

### 8. Ratios & Proportions (Ch. 4)

> Please explain ratios in math like I am in middle school. Start with simple comparisons, like 2 apples to 5 oranges = 2:5. Then explain how to write ratios as fractions and convert them to percentages, like 2/5 = 40%. Show how to compare two ratios, for example deciding whether 2/5 is bigger than 3/8. Then explain proportions — equations where two ratios are equal, like 2/5 = 4/10. Use small, everyday examples.

👉 In finance, ratios help compare numbers like debt to equity or profits to sales (profit margin).

### 9. Statistics (Basic) (Ch. 4, 7)

> Please explain the most basic statistics concepts step by step. Start with average (mean), then explain median (middle value), and mode (most common value). Show me how to calculate variance in a very simple way: measure how far numbers are from the average. Then explain standard deviation as the square root of variance. Use tiny datasets, like 2, 4, 6, and walk me through calculations slowly.

👉 In finance, variance and standard deviation measure how risky an investment is by showing how much returns vary.

### 10. Applied Math Tools (Order & Calculator Logic) (Ch. 2–3, 6, 8)

> Please explain the order of operations in math (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction). Give simple examples where following the wrong order gives the wrong answer. Then explain how to carefully enter calculations into a calculator, step by step. Use small examples like (2 + 3) × 4. Also show why it’s important to clear the calculator’s memory when solving multiple problems. Keep everything very beginner-friendly.

👉 In finance, correct order of operations matters when using a financial Texas Instrument BA II Plus calculator for NPV or IRR calculations.
